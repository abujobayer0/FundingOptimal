      {
        question: 'Are you a broker?',
        answer:
          "We are a proprietary trading firm, not a broker. We don't take deposits from traders to manage their own funds. Instead, traders pay a fee to participate in our evaluation process, and upon success, gain access to trade with our firm's capital under strict risk controls.",
      },
      {
        question: 'What trading platform do we offer?',

        question: 'Do we use real funds in our trades?',

        question: 'What is the Account Inactivity Policy?',
        answer:
          'All accounts are subject to a 30-day inactivity rule. If an account remains inactive for 30 consecutive calendar days (no trading activity), it will be automatically closed and permanently deactivated. Logging in alone is not considered activity - a trade must be placed to reset the timer.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Which countries are restricted?',
        answer:

        answer:
          'Daily drawdown limit is calculated based on the starting balance of the day, not on equity. The daily balance resets at 00:00 GMT+2. For example, if your account balance is $10,000 and daily limit is 5%, your maximum loss cannot exceed $500 for that day.',
      },

    title: 'Important Trading Terms',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What are Bid and Ask Prices in Forex?',
        answer:
          'In forex trading, currency pairs are quoted with two prices: the bid and ask. The ask price is the rate at which a broker is willing to sell a currency (shown on the right side of quotes). The bid price is the rate a broker offers to purchase a currency (shown on the left side). For example, if EUR/USD is quoted at 1.1400/1.1402, the bid is 1.1400 (what you receive when selling euros) and ask is 1.1402 (what you pay when buying euros). The spread is the difference between these prices.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is Slippage in Trading?',
        answer:
          'Slippage occurs when a trade is executed at a different price than intended, usually due to rapid market movements or execution delays. This happens most often during high volatility (major economic announcements) or low liquidity periods (market openings, off-hours). For example, if you set a Take Profit at 1.1000 but it fills at 1.0995 due to sudden price movement, that 5-pip difference is slippage. It can be positive (better price) or negative (worse price).',
      },
      {
        question: 'What are Swap, Triple Swap, and Rollover Period?',
        answer:
          'A swap is an overnight interest charge or credit applied when trades remain open past the trading day end, based on interest rate differences between currencies. Triple swap is a larger rollover fee applied on Wednesdays to cover the weekend period when markets are closed. The rollover period is the daily moment (usually around midnight server time) when the platform shifts trades into the next trading day and applies swap charges. During this time, spreads may widen due to reduced liquidity.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What are Margin, Leverage, and Equity?',
        answer:
          "Margin is the collateral required to open and hold a trade - funds locked by your broker to cover potential losses. Leverage amplifies your trading power (e.g., 100:1 lets you control $100,000 with $1,000), increasing both profit potential and risk. Equity is your account's real-time value including unrealized profits/losses: Equity = Account Balance + Unrealized P/L. If open trades are profitable, equity exceeds balance; if losing, equity drops below balance.",
      },
      {
        question: 'What is Spread in Forex?',
        answer:
          'Spread is the difference between the buying price (ask) and selling price (bid) of a currency pair, measured in pips. It represents the cost of entering a trade. For example, if EUR/USD shows Bid: 1.1400, Ask: 1.1405, the spread is 5 pips. The market must move at least 5 pips in your favor before becoming profitable. Spreads widen during volatile markets, news releases, low liquidity periods, and rollover times, increasing trading costs.',
